## Our Pledge
We, the maintainers and contributors of **Web Generative UI**, are committed to fostering an open, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for everyone. Our goal is to create a community where individuals of all backgrounds—regardless of age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or any other characteristic—can collaborate to advance AI-driven, dynamic web interfaces. We value diverse perspectives and strive to make participation in our project a positive and respectful experience for all.
