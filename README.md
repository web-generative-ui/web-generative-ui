## Installation

To get started with Web Generative UI, install it via npm:

```bash
npm install web-generative-ui
```

# Prerequisites

Node.js >= 16.x
A modern frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, or Angular)
Access to a Model Context Protocol-compatible AI service (see Setup)

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to create a dynamic, AI-driven text input component using Web Generative UI:

```javascript
import {GenerativeUI} from 'web-generative-ui';

// Initialize the library with your Model Context Protocol API key
const gui = new GenerativeUI({
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    model: 'mcp-model-1',
});

// Create a dynamic input component
gui.createComponent({
    type: 'text-input',
    container: '#app',
    context: 'Generate a personalized greeting based on user input',
});
```

```html
<div id="app"></div>
```

Run your application, and the input will dynamically adapt its content based on the AI model!

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have installed the library and required dependencies (
   see [Installation](#installation)).
2. **Configure Model Context Protocol**:
    - Sign up for an MCP-compatible AI service (e.g., [MCP Provider](https://mcp-provider.example.com)).
    - Obtain an API key and add it to your environment variables:
      ```bash
      export MCP_API_KEY='your-api-key'
      ```
3. **Initialize the Library:**: 
    - Import and configure the library as shown in the Quick Start section.
4. Optional: Customize component styles and behavior via the configuration object (see Documentation).

## Usage Examples
### Example 1: Personalized Product Recommendations
Create a UI component that generates product suggestions based on user preferences:

```javascript
const gui = new GenerativeUI({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  model: 'mcp-recommendation-model',
});

gui.createComponent({
  type: 'recommendation-list',
  container: '#recommendations',
  context: 'Suggest products based on user browsing history',
  options: { maxItems: 5 },
});
```

### Example 2: Dynamic Chat Interface
Build a conversational UI that adapts to user input in real-time:
```javascript
gui.createComponent({
  type: 'chat-box',
  container: '#chat',
  context: 'Engage users in a conversational flow',
  options: { theme: 'dark' },
});
```
