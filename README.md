# Generative UI Library

A lightweight, schema-driven library for rendering dynamic user interfaces from declarative JSON payloads, designed for applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

This library provides a robust framework to transform a structured JSON schema into a tree of interactive web components, with on-demand loading for maximum performance and flexibility.

## Features

-   **Schema-Driven UI**: Define complex user interfaces using a simple, declarative JSON structure.
-   **Web Component Based**: Renders to native, encapsulated, and reusable Web Components.
-   **Dynamic Component Loading**: Components are loaded and registered on-demand ("just-in-time"), minimizing initial bundle size and improving performance.
-   **LLM-Friendly**: Built to handle dynamic and unpredictable UI structures generated by LLMs. The system gracefully handles requests for components it knows how to render.
-   **Extensible**: Easily add new custom components by creating a new class and adding it to the component registry.
-   **Type-Safe**: Comes with a full TypeScript schema for a great developer experience and compile-time safety.

## How It Works

The library is built around three core concepts:

1.  **The JSON Schema**: A declarative structure that represents your UI. Each object in the `children` array is a `Component` with a `component` property (e.g., `"card"`, `"text"`, `"table"`) that determines what to render.

2.  **The `Registry`**: The central singleton for managing components. It maintains a mapping of schema component names to their corresponding web component classes. When asked to render a UI, it dynamically finds, loads, and registers any components that haven't been seen before.

3.  **The `Interpreter`**: Responsible for parsing a UI payload and recursively rendering it into the DOM. It works with the `Registry` to ensure all necessary components are available before creating their corresponding HTML elements (`<ui-card>`, `<ui-text>`, etc.).

4.  **The `UI components`**: The predefined components that make up the UI, extends from native Web Components.
