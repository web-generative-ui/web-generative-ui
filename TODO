Implement Styling & Theming (Design System Integration) (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Refine Component styling & theming to match the design system
Implement dedicated transition for each component state change
Introduce more flexible layout mechanism
Accessibility (ONGOING)
route UI actions out to registered handlers and optionally back to the server via a callback API [ActionDispatcher],

Components to implement
    | Chart
    | CodeBlock

Roadmap (phased, incremental)
Phase 4 — ActionDispatcher & callbacks
Implement ActionDispatcher with default DOM event hooking.
Add optional server callback support via transport or HTTP.
Add onAction hook in start() options.

Phase 5 — Persistence, UI history components, and tooling
Provide optional history UI components (e.g., UiHistoryList) that read from ConversationStore.
Add tests, examples, and docs.

Phase 6 — Advanced features
Branching replies, multi-model session switching, server-initiated instructions (control messages).
Access control, telemetry, instrumentation.
